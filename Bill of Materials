•	The Voltmeter 0-6V was a Dallas Meter TEK, DMT-0001 , I found it as a unused surplus meter on EBAY.  I chose this meter because it had a large face ( 5 inch diameter ) and about 270 degree of movement. 
•	The Meter face overlay was made on a sheet of white glossy photographic paper that was trimmed to size to fit over the existing meter faceplate. I simply used an inkjet printer to print the new scale on the photographic paper. To make the new scale I used a software Application called “Meter” by Tonne Software. Their webpage is https://www.tonnesoftware.com/index.html    - Jim Tonne did give me some assistance in the faceplate design as I had a few questions about getting the design correct . The price was very reasonable and it really made the meter face look totally professional.  The meter design file can also be found on Github although you will need the Tonne Meter software to open it. 
•	Barometer body : Below the meter face I used a section of 6” PVC sewer pipe cut to about 2.25” length to protect the back of the meter and the application electronics. It was painted Brite metallic gold (Ace Hardware)  to match the brass finish of the meter which was originally painted black. I had removed the black paint with acetone.  A 5.5 mm barrel jack allows quick disconnect of the DC power supply.
